How to update cateories


1. Edit and save categorymap.xlsx
2. Run

   node cats

3. check in and push

cats.js recalcuates new category files from the spreadsheet and writes them to the /assets directory.  These are static files that are checked in, so simply pushing to production makes the new categories visible.
