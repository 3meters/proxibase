Facebook account kit test.  Currently this test requires a fresh account kit authorization_code which can only be generated by a phone calling their ios or android sdk, then grepping our logs for the last authorization code.  Paste that into the test as the value for the module global authorization_code variable and run the test once.  Start over from the phone to run the test again, but the act of using the authorization code for the test expires it. Awesome.  Test lives outside of basic for obvious reasons.
